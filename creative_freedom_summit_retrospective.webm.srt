1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we have Emma and Jess talking about what they learned about the creative freedom summit.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So give a hand for them.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hi everybody and welcome to our talk. We're very excited to be here at Fasten. It's the first time here.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So very excited and nervous. Had a great time yesterday.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So today we're just going to go through a summit that we hosted two weeks ago.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to explain what it is for people who weren't aware of it and then we're also going to see what went well and what could be improved.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So just a small introduction first then. So my name is Emma Kidney.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm an associate software engineer at Red Hat in their community platform engineering team.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Kind of the last year. So I've kind of been more doing design work.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Kind of slowly doing more design work, less dev work.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm part of the Fedora design team and I utilize Floss in every aspect of my work.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And an active member of the Fedora community.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So I'll just pass it over to Jess then.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So I'm Jess and so I joined the Red Hat team in 2022 as a Fedora community designer intern.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
For the community platform engineering group.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And I've got all open source software, Inkscape, Penpart of course.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And just loads of other ones and creating numerous logos for the Fedora project as well that you might have seen around.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Includes.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So yeah, so a little bit of the creative freedom summit.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It was a summit that we held, was it two weeks ago?

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah, two weeks ago.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, so it was all over like Jitsie and PeerTube.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And it's just, again, promoting loads of creative software that people might know about.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So yeah, basically, yeah, what is the creative freedom summit?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So it's a virtual event focused on promoting open source tools,

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
spreading knowledge of how to use them and connecting creators across the FOSS ecosystem.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So the summit's accomplishments and shortcomings will be examined in light of the first year.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So the primary goals for this were, of course,

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
promote open source creative software and also spreading knowledge of how to use it.

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So it's very important like there's so many free software that people don't know about

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and it's great to give them that recognition.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And also connecting creators across the FOSS ecosystem.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So other people who use these open source software can connect with each other

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and share ideas and all that sort of stuff.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then our secondary goals were to promote the Fedora design team as well as a welcoming group.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So, you know, especially if you don't have a platform to show off

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
like what you've done on open source software,

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
you can always join the Fedora design team.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We also create a potential onboarding path for new design contributors as well

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and spread info on how to use the creative open source tools in communities.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So again, same as the last one,

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
so showing how the Fedora design team wields tools to make communities stuff happen

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and have sessions like how the Fedora design team do this, that and the other

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and hoping it makes sense for easier for people to get involved.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So what topics do we cover?

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So again, pen path.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So if you don't know what it is, if you missed the first talk,

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
it's a web-based design and prototyping platform.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Inkscape as well, which I love.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And powerful, it's a vector-based graphics editor.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Blender, Krita and Caden Live, I assume you might have went to the KDE stand that was around.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And GIMP and also accessibility as well, which is very important in the design aspect of things,

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
like color blindness palettes and stuff like that.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And then the free software was actually, it's like free patterns for different crafts,

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
so more kind of a hands-on design thing rather than technical.

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And creative professional using open-source software.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So we had some people as well who, and of course us as well, like using free open-source

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
in a professional aspect and many others.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So we had an amazing line-up of speakers, so Maureen Duffy and David Revoy to name a few.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And we had social hours that include the audience and help build a sense of community.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So some of these include a hack and craft, which is kind of like the free software.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's by the same person, Morgan Lemmerweber.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And so we were basically, like for the hack and craft, we were all like knitting and making,

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
sewing things, but also talking about open-source and Pictioner and Gartik Phone.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So it was really fun.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And then, of course, wouldn't be possible without our sponsors.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So Fedora and Red Hat were the main sponsors.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And then the platforms we used to share was Wee's Element.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So like people could interact in the chat.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Jitsie was for the live streaming part.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, sorry. Jitsie was the video part.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So we all went into a call, and then Peerchu was the live streaming part of it.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, yeah, I'm going to hand you over to Emma for the retrospective.

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Nice. Okay. The retrospective.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So just some details then as well.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So when it took place, as Jess said, around two weeks ago, January 17th to the 19th.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What platform?

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We used Jitsie, streamed with Peerchu, and then Element and Matrix were used for the audience to interact with each other and the speakers.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What if you didn't make it?

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The recordings are available on the Create Freedom Summit's Peerchu.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And we'll soon be uploaded to the Fedora YouTube when editing is complete, where we have some great contributors at the minute,

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
converting the raw video files over into properly caught and published talks.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And was there a badge?

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The important question when an event is run by Fedora.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes, there was a badge. It was designed by Jess, again.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And it was able to be claimed by anyone with Fedora badges account.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And it was claimed around 48 times, I believe.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And also, if you're wondering why we had a badge, the summit was all about promoting open source design.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And then obviously, as the Fedora design team, there can be a lot of overlap then between the two communities.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Here's just an example of what the setup looked like if you were to attend the summit.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So at the top there, you have a little widget for the live stream.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We have another little kind of notepad feature there where you can type out any questions you might have,

93
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
some information kind of frequently asked questions, and then we have the chat there then.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So people can interact with each other.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Also, the background channel for the talk.

96
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, yeah.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, yeah, because if you wanted to just watch the talk and I've been involved in the chat room,

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
you just watch directly with the PeerTube link as well.

99
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How did the event go?

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It went very well.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We had 18 speakers take part with an average of 50 viewers per session, which is very good for our first time round.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We had more than 700 unique viewers spread out across 54 different countries.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And in the element chat room, we came up to around 250 members.

104
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So we were kind of aiming for 100 in the element chat room, but so the fact we kind of doubled that grade.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So what went well?

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Viewers loved the setup we had.

107
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They were able to watch videos soon after they were live as well, due to the system that we were using.

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And the chat room was very friendly and there was a real strong sense of community there.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And the audience had a lot of back and forth with the speakers as well.

110
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There was a lot of interactions at the social event and a lot of interest.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Also, no code of conduct issues, which is always nice.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, so we got to see some amazing work.

113
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So we had, let's say, some speed painting sessions there with grease pencil and blender.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's been painting with Krita, an inkscape tutorial.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There's a software blender as well.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There was a good few things about blender.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, so what can we improve for next year?

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So what didn't work?

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're going to try and create a guide for next year with guidance on how to use the platform.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Because from a newbie perspective, if you're not familiar with matrix element,

121
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
or that kind of thing, it can be a bit foreign, a bit hard to get into.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We also need to look into auto captions then as well.

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Since we did not have live captions during the summer, we were able to add them in post-production,

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
but it would have been nice to have it while the event was happening.

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So we're going to look into some open source tools that can be used alongside Jitsie.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hopefully we can stick with that arrangement and then, if not, maybe look into some alternatives.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, so what's next then?

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So call for proposals.

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So depending on speaker capacity and interest,

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
we'll probably do a call for proposals around two to three months prior to the event.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There's a lot of interest in the audience to get involved themselves, present their own talks,

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and share their knowledge.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We want to keep group and interaction growing throughout the year.

134
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This can bring more people into the community, maintain their interests,

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
so maybe have socials, our challenges, kind of little, mini events.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Spread the word, so participate in talks like this one.

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Kind of get involved in more of the open source design forms, all the different communities.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Planning is a major part, so we're going to give ourselves some more time to implement improvements,

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
try some things out, and then if any areas come up.

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So yeah, I'm going to pass you over to Jess, then, just in case you're interested in participating in Fedora.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
So a little bit of a segue, I suppose, since we're all, it's very heavily supported by the Fedora design team,

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
so if you would like to be interested in the next one,

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
so if you would like to, there's a Fedora account that you can create,

144
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
you can create it at accounts.fadoraproduct.org, and you can use it to sign into the element as well,

145
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and it's very, kind of, it's like the main account to use, especially with a somewhat like this.

146
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So if you want to learn more about Fedora, it's all on the Fedora docs,

147
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and also if you do join.fadoraproduct.org, it gives you all the links that you can use as well.

148
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It shows our missions, our foundations, all the user documentation,

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and you can look us up and ping us if you need anything.

150
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
And then also, yeah, you can hang out with us.

151
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
So in the element chat, we have a Fedora design element chat,

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
where people share what they've been contributing,

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
and if anyone needs feedback from, like, the more senior people,

154
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
or, like, just in general, it's a really good place to be.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Fedora marketing as well, and there's many more challenges as well,

156
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
even if you're not really interested in design, there's infrastructure, there's many more loads.

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So, and yeah, where to find us?

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
So the matrix channel there, creativefreedom.dot.fadora.im,

159
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and then our website is creativefreedom.dot.com, where you can get all the information,

160
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and we have, like, when we were playing it as well,

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we had all of our, we had a live, like, schedule going on,

162
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
and you can click on it, and it brings you to the streams,

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and then, again, the Fedora design team matrix channel is there,

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and then that's us.

165
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So if you have any questions?

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah, so.

167
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We're planning on making it kind of like an annual, an annual event,

168
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
so it'll hopefully happen around January next year as well.

169
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So feel free to enter the matrix channel, ping myself or Jess,

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
we'd be more than happy to punch in the right direction,

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
if you're not sure on how to use matrix or element, anything like that.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So yeah, I think that's our talk.

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you.

174
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Does anyone have any questions?

175
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No?

176
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

177
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes.

178
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So I understand that some people are online this year.

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you plan to keep that format for the future?

180
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah, because it's, I suppose it's making open source design tools

181
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
kind of more accessible.

182
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So we'd like to kind of keep it a virtual event, I think,

183
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
for the foreseeable future.

184
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Maybe there might be some mini events, things like that.

185
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We haven't really discussed it, but we do like the online aspect

186
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
that anyone can join.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
So it is, yeah.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah, I suppose.

189
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, just making it more accessible for people.

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So anyone else have any questions?

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Or would you like to see more of the next one?

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
So I'll just repeat the question.

194
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So we were just asked, what would we like to see more of in the next summit?

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So I suppose, just getting the numbers off.

196
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Well, you know, it's good to see, you know, just make it more,

197
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
well, it is approachable, I suppose, but I don't know.

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's a tough question.

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'd like to see more of the craft inside a thing

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and the open source design aspect,

201
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
but I thought that was really interesting when Morgan came in

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and was talking about having, you know, open source design, say,

203
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
of like sewing patterns, things like that,

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
making clothing more accessible to people.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It was kind of an aspect of design I didn't really think of,

206
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
even though I'm into like crocheting and knitting and stuff myself.

207
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So it was mad just to kind of see like a hobby

208
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and like work kind of come together then.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So I thought that was quite interesting.

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, I'd like to see more of that.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay, yeah, we also have a stand-down in building H as well.

212
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
So we'll probably be there after this.

213
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah, thank you.
