1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,880
Wednesday, when we did the unboxing event, that since we do hope that everyone will be

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,600
welcomed to a Penpot project, we needed to make sure that the invite system could cope

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,800
with all the different use cases that you get with that link expiration, who got the

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,960
invite, do any tree send it, etc., etc.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,720
Otherwise, the onboarding experience would be tough and people would not be joining the

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,400
design project.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:44,200
And this is very important for us because this is not only a tool for designers to just

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,320
express their creativity, but also for developers to join the design process to be welcomed there.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,880
So this is very important for us.

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,440
But of course, we had many improvements in the interactive prototype feature.

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,640
This is just one example for the overlay advancement.

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:13,920
So here you can see how a design asset is being self-referred and you get a very nice

13
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,440
pixel-perfect overlay on a button and then an animation that comes with a mouse click.

14
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
Right?

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Do you like this?

16
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
I think you do.

17
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Yeah, I think you do.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
This is happening.

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
This is...

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
This is happening.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
This is...

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
This is amazing.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
So this is just about a token.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:41,080
I do mean, I mean, do go and enjoy Penpot, but it has many, many features on advanced prototyping,

25
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,160
but this is one thing that actually came from this official release.

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:56,280
As it did nested boards, so here you can see in this animation like an independent board

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,720
being dragged to another board and having this nesting effect.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:07,480
This actually was a bit tricky because as you know, Penpot uses SVG like natively.

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,760
So when I say open standards, we do really mean open standards.

30
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,240
And it was tough to have this root element having everything, so to have different independent

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,520
components being designed, we had to do this nested board trick, but that trick actually

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,080
gave us a lot of potential because when you have nested boards, you can do much more advanced

33
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,800
compositing in general, and so we have like the best of world worlds.

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:47,680
We have SVG, but also these neat tricks for compositing.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,920
Also let me remind you, for those of you that don't know much about Penpot, that we have

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,520
like some innovations in terms of where to find stuff.

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,040
When you do engineering, you think about scale, like I need to scale up.

38
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I need to automate.

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,120
I need to have everything like in tiny bits so I can combine them any way I want.

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,160
With design, with big design architectures, you have that same challenge, otherwise it

41
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,040
gets just manual, like design is just manual, and it can only go as far as your brain can

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,400
cope with stuff.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,080
So having like your components, your libraries and assets readily available here, whether

44
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,360
there are fonts or colors or design tokens or whatever, it's really cool.

45
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,200
Also a whole lot of libraries, and you drag and drop, or you create new ones, and they

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,680
are there on your left pane.

47
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:51,200
So this actually comes from the Penpot design system, which is the first one example that

48
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,920
you can one-click import.

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,680
If you go to Penpot, you do the onboarding, it's very nice, by the way it's a nice bottle

50
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,360
challenge that you can try and do.

51
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,680
Anyone here did the bottle challenge?

52
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,000
Some of you do, it's a nice little game where you learn by fun, like it's like you learn

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,720
the Penpot basics using this bottle challenge.

54
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,880
But when you actually go into more advanced topics, this is what you really need.

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:28,680
So go and check the Penpot design system because it's kind of neatly organized.

56
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,480
And then we get something so cool that no one had, which is FlexLayout.

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,920
So every design and prototyping system out there would have this killer feature where

58
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,600
you can smartly apply rules to your design.

59
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Say I want my design to flow this way and then you would change the content within that

60
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,840
design and those rules would apply automatically.

61
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,800
So for designers, I'm seeing people are saying yes, yes, I know why we're talking here.

62
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,200
Some designers would feel a massive productivity boost thanks to that.

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,240
You can call it auto layout, smart layout, fancy layout, whatever.

64
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,280
They could not have this once they were exposed to that.

65
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,320
It's like not having this once you know about this intelligent layout system is like going

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,960
really back in time and having to do everything manually.

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:39,080
So the problem with this as we thought at Penpot was that unfortunately these layout

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:49,200
systems were design-centric, which is not bad per se, but was not developer-friendly.

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Basically it was not team-friendly, meaning designers would do their smart layout system

70
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,360
and then all the vocabulary and the ideas, the abstractions were just for the designers

71
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:07,440
to understand and to enjoy and then developers would go there and say I need to translate

72
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,600
this into code.

73
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,040
Let's hope there's no issues, by the way, issues.

74
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,800
Not only technical issues but also friction issues like back and forth.

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,320
This am I in control?

76
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,960
No, I'm not.

77
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,880
Neither the designer nor the developer.

78
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,640
They would feel like they would have to constantly double-check and you don't scale up your design

79
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,400
or your code if you have to do that.

80
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,840
Penpot came with a completely different approach and said what if we have code first design

81
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,200
layout?

82
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,200
What if already the design is the code?

83
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,800
You can do a ton of stuff with Flex CSS.

84
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,520
It's actually quite advanced.

85
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:03,440
So what if we say let's do a developer first design layout system and we came up with Flex

86
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,080
layout and please do a plot here because it's the first ever tool to have this and it's

87
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:17,000
open source.

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,120
The great thing about this is that this is not a gift from engineers to designers saying

89
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
I made this for you, please use it.

90
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,560
I hope you're excited about this but actually designers wanted this.

91
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,000
So no compromises, everyone wins.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,760
We got 50 to 60 volunteers for the better testing of this.

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,040
I'm not saying you could not test it using our development branch but like the proper

94
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:54,280
environment setup for people to go and do some simple tests like this one and give us

95
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,560
feedback and the feedback was phenomenal.

96
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,960
I think 80% came from designers and 20% from engineers.

97
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,840
So that was nice.

98
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,520
Given the fact that in the world so that you know it statistically there's one designer

99
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,720
pretend developers roughly.

100
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,600
We don't think that's a good ratio.

101
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,680
At colleagues we have one to two so pretty different.

102
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,520
Somewhere in between perhaps one to four would be great but of course to better test this

103
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,120
we couldn't have the one to ten ratio in our poll.

104
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,040
We needed to reverse that.

105
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,160
But we didn't have to work hard to achieve that because designers were actually asking

106
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,960
to better test this in the first place.

107
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:47,520
So if you're familiar with flex CSS you can see properties there and then of course you

108
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,960
get I'm here I'm simulating to this is a real time collaboration because we do have real

109
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,400
time collaboration of course and this is like two browsers.

110
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,160
It doesn't look like that because I made it like fix a perfect in a way but that code

111
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,360
pane there the coding spec is actually a second browser just just beneath right nothing fancy

112
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,440
but you can see how real time that is changing.

113
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,320
So a designer is changing the design using flex layout and as the designer does that

114
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,320
the developer can see that code being changed just is a different tab selection there that's

115
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
that's all it takes.

116
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,920
So I'm not saying that a developer should like be like quickly copy and pasting when

117
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,880
it changes but it's nice for for the demo now you see that it's real there's no like

118
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:57,720
export concept of anything and really that's it thank you it happened I do hope we have

119
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,280
some time for question because I planned for that that is great over the whole point okay

120
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:24,480
I'd rather not pick if you could you could store that but not yeah and is there any kind

121
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,880
of process I can follow to do we have something that exists to guide me so the question was

122
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:49,120
about perhaps migrating the design system from you could you could so if you're using

123
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,160
a design system on Figma right now and you want also to use pen pod there's a ton of

124
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,960
overlap so it might feel weird for you to use the two if not you're not migrating the answer

125
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,280
is I'm not sure it makes sense because it is about team dynamics this is about people

126
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,600
collaborating so unless you want to export these Figma assets and use it like privately

127
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,720
for you with no going back if that is I mean you're smiling so I guess that that's what

128
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:29,440
I want I want to live in my private open source world okay but that that seems to me I get

129
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I get that you you can save some money doing that but honestly it's going to not save you

130
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,440
much time so you have to keep a balance there because it's going to be back and forth not

131
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,320
within pen pod but within two tools that compete in the space of the use case but I mean go

132
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,840
ahead and tell me how it looks perhaps I'm mistaken but I think it's going to have a

133
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,880
bit of overhead for you if you're willing to take that you have a sticker you I'll give

134
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,960
you a sticker like the shiny one you know okay by the way who was my ask a question

135
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,560
who was here three years ago can you raise your hand okay yeah okay we have stickers

136
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:21,720
like super premium stickers for you I so my question is you showed us there was a live

137
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:41,480
update of this yes so the question is we saw the real time transformation between the

138
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,720
design and the code is it full duplex can I change the code not for now not for now

139
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:58,120
but of course I mean it feels like you would like to do the other way around I'll actually

140
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:06,000
go on with that question theme and say what if you connect that with a gear repository

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,840
and you change that in the gear repository that comes back and changes the design what

142
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,000
if as a designer you change something that also goes to the gear repository and triggers

143
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:28,440
a CICD process ah okay so we thought about that because it's kind of what comes next

144
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:50,280
obviously but yeah so good question we've got to cover it okay thank you

145
00:13:50,280 --> 00:14:15,880
so resources for helping teams migrating from other tools to Penpot yeah yeah I mean

146
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:28,720
Figma what is that Figma owns 80% of the market for designers 80% Adobe now owns 87% of the

147
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:37,960
market thanks to that so obviously yeah I get that we have a plug-in an expert plug-in

148
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,920
it's we hope that the community can help us just improve it so that you can basically

149
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,560
export all that from we actually don't know how much time we've got for that plug-in to

150
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,880
be okay for Figma but it's still there so that is one way you can quickly test that

151
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,600
it's not any means complete so it will give you like the basics but it might be enough

152
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,840
and then I think everything like exporting stuff and just uh re-importing that is really

153
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:14,080
quick for teams to have the design system re-uploaded here somehow I don't think it's

154
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,840
going to take much time if you have the motivation it's just you know some I mean depending on

155
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,080
the complexity of the prototypes and design this is for prototyping and this is also for

156
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:28,200
design so depending on the quality for each topic it might get but yeah the export plug-in

157
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,680
we really hope that we get more help from the contribution from the community so if

158
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:42,920
anyone here is interested in like those like serialization challenges for the SVG and the

159
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,600
JSON because it's all it has really that would be great from the abstraction model

160
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,840
that we have from Figma to actually proper you know open standards fine so yeah those

161
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:08,960
um good um thank you

162
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,040
I'm curious about the business side things you mentioned Figma and how do you plan to

163
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:24,200
continue to Figma and be successful at it and at the same time drive your business forward?

164
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,000
So Kaleidos is a company um actually the original title is Kaleidos's open source that's the

165
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,240
SL because we're a Spanish company um so the idea for us is to make sure that we follow

166
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,960
this um we think it's going to be uh kind of an enterprise edition that will give companies

167
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:48,880
things that the power user does not want or doesn't need we call that privately publicly

168
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:56,600
tax the controller okay so that is uh something that we don't really need right now because

169
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,680
to be honest there's still a ton of things that we have to do for the product but basically

170
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:10,600
uh perhaps in two years if we are relevant we hope we are relevant we'll see uh see you

171
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,880
in two years force them you know but uh if we are really relevant then uh we will look

172
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,600
for those tax the controller uh features that big companies are fine uh they won't contribute

173
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:31,160
with code they won't contribute with content they will contribute with money right so we

174
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,560
don't have like the details but it's going to be like and this has been publicly said

175
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,480
many times the power user gets open source forever is the companies wanting to have this

176
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,840
control mechanism that will have to pay for something that is exclusive to them whether

177
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,560
it's self-host or SaaS we don't care actually by the way there is also a desktop app by

178
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:57,160
the community um that encapsulated Penpot with Electron so you can also have the pure

179
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:03,000
desktop native you know experience um so yeah um it's it's there actually in the community

180
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,440
space community.Penpot.app we elaborate a bit more on that but yeah the only way this

181
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:15,960
will be sustainable is a company is that we are really relevant um surprisingly the the

182
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:23,200
design space in our view is quite immature like you have one tool you know winner takes

183
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,600
all then the next tool then the next there are subsequent winners uh we hope that we

184
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,800
add fragmentation to that uh but still uh and so be be be relevant so we have like

185
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,120
one minute left if you the answer a question you answer the second part and this is the

186
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,200
first part of the hug actually you tend to compete with Figma you tend to maybe drive

187
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,120
business away from Figma toward Penpot. Well I think uh will we the the playbook that we

188
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,520
have is quite unique and unprecedented like this is open source design and prototyping tool

189
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:05,760
so we hope that we have a bottom-up uh distribution model like people are really saying this is

190
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,280
actually much better and uh we are hoping this is this is part of our yeah this is hope that you

191
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,080
remember that ratio one designer pretend developers that developers actually loving open source

192
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,200
do bring um Penpot to the forefront without the help from open source developers I'm sure this

193
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,360
is not going to happen not because design open designers don't like open source just because

194
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:37,360
the the economics of that will take much longer um so yeah that one to ten ratio is the only

195
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,920
what is the only time I would I'm happy with that ratio like in this particular case it's like

196
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,600
so we are counting on open source developers today. Okay if you want to have a chat afterwards

197
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,160
and I'm sure Pablo is very very happy to answer questions so that's we have five minutes for

198
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:20,240
people to leave and people to come in so I'm going to say thank you Pablo. Thank you.
