00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Hello, folks. Welcome to my talk. I'm Akash Deep Dhar. Today I'm going to talk about Linux

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,360
distribution state of gaming. I'll talk a little bit about myself first. Basically, I'm

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,600
someone who has been contributing to Fedora project for around a couple of years before

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,200
they thought the folks who actually help the Fedora distribution as a corporate entity,

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,360
they thought that, well, I'm not going to leave anyway, so they might as well hire me.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,560
The next thing that I find myself doing is actually working as a software engineer for

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,920
a team that manages infrastructure for Fedora as well as CentOS. It's called the community

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,320
platform engineering team. As well as, you know, just because Fedora is kind of close

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,720
to my heart, I mean, it's kind of CentOS at this point in time, but misappropriation.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,000
I work for Fedora council as well as being the objective representative for the Fedora

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,360
website synapse team. Gaming has been a prime concern for me, especially having laptops

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,600
that don't quite run games. So the thing that I used to do is have distributions that can

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,680
actually have a greater headroom assigned to that game instead of running some fancy

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,560
stuff in the background. So that is what has been the entry point for Linux distributions

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,600
for me. So over the course of last five years, I have written and demonstrated multiple talks,

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,920
multiple articles around how to be able to run video games on GNLinux distributions, how

17
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,800
to be able to benchmark them, and while driver install is too while we're at it.

18
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,400
Right. So I watched this movie called Zootopia and there's this Fox character that I can't

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,560
remember the name of. So he tells that, you know, the best way of giving a talk is to

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,840
ask a question to themselves first and then answering that question. So I guess I'll do

21
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,360
that. So we can ask ourselves three questions about the state of gaming and Linux distributions.

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,080
The first being, is it popular? The second being, is it convenient to make happen? And

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,240
the third being, is it performant? Like why even consider gaming on Linux distributions

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,960
when there is some other consoles? There are other platforms which are actually willing

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,560
to do that. So it certainly is popular. I mean, we can totally thank our friends at

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,920
Valve for the Steam Deck and for other people who run a lot of games on their Android iPhones.

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,480
I mean, Android is Linux, all right. But then again, is it the way we kind of want it to

28
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,120
be popular? So there's this small asterisk over there. We have things for emulation.

29
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,240
We have things operating systems dedicated for running video games, like distributions

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,240
like Battlesale Linux, Lacca, which runs retro arch and nothing else on the bottom of it.

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,720
And there's this thing called Retropie, which runs emulation stations. So if you must have

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,760
gotten yourself a Raspberry Pi and looked for something in the Internet, some DIY tutorial,

33
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
it's probably one of the first five things you will end up seeing. And finally, consoles

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,400
that actually use Linux on the top of them. Speaking of convenience, it is convenient.

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,760
Is it convenient to run Linux distributions for gaming? And you most certainly will have

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,680
different opinions regarding the kind of configurations that you want to do. If you want to tailor

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,360
fit your stuff, get the frame rates that you want and the quality that you need, there

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,160
are more configurations to like bare bones wine, retro arch so that you can tailor fit

39
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:39,320
your stuff or something like Android phones or Steam Deck, which can do that for you.

40
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,200
And finally, we have performance. Now, I have seen this over the course of years running

41
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,020
video games on Linux, the things that are supposed to run on Windows, that if the games

42
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:56,720
run, well, if they do, they usually end up being 15 to 30% more performant. You can totally

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,440
find the references in the slide deck if the font's a bit too small, that, yeah, this

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,120
thing is actually the case. But what exactly is the sacrifice here? Also, I mean, I can

45
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,640
pass through a GPU. If I have this big GPU, I can pass it through virtual machines and

46
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:21,040
have near native performances instead of doing, say, on a hardware that is totally not okay

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,400
for a certain game to run. But, yeah, why exactly do I have those asterisks out there?

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,920
If it's performant, if it's convenient, if it's popular, then what's with the terms

49
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:39,520
and conditions, supply kind of thing that I have over there? And, well, there are things

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,600
that we're missing out. So one of the first things that we do is it is popular, people

51
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,400
are enthusiastic about it, but less people are enthusiastic about it. And it's usually

52
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,080
the people who would like to spend their hours configuring things, writing config files, hacking

53
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,600
stuff to be able to run some games on their desktop or their handheld devices that run

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:10,080
Linux distributions. And that's barely around 1.38%. And that's the service about where

55
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,400
I got that 1.38% from. It is something that has been going up since the last couple of

56
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,760
years. Here again, we have the friends at work to thank for for the Steam Deck that

57
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,120
we are getting increased usage. But a lot of these users are totally going unaccounted

58
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,160
for because telemetry is a big no-no for us. And we definitely advertise telemetry as

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,040
something that we should not do. And, well, when there are things like Lutris, things

60
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:46,200
like RetroPy, RetroArch, then PlayOnLinux, Wine, these tools are doing the best that

61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,320
they can do. But guess what? We don't get to know how exactly are these being used.

62
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,760
And as a result, the publishers, they think that, well, Linux distributions, who uses

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,480
Linux distributions, why should we port our games in Linux distributions? We better not.

64
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,080
We might as well create them for other platforms. Well, I won't name any, but with comparatively

65
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,720
higher market share, right, of our consoles. Because guess what? Consoles are supposed

66
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,640
to be for gaming, not for writing code. And then, you know, third-party developers, they

67
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,720
don't bother. They don't really care. They are like, ah, fine. They'll use their stuff

68
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,600
to emulate our games on their platform. They call Wine an emulator. We know the difference.

69
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,240
They probably don't. So I go have my friends have a conversation

70
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,040
with my friends that, yeah, you play this game on Windows. Here's how it can run on

71
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,960
Linux. And they're like, oh, my God. That's too many configuration files. That's too many

72
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,440
hours of work. And all my friends are on Windows. So sorry about that, brother. But I'm going

73
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,880
to be at Windows as well. And the other person, they try installing games. But guess what?

74
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,160
It's a multiplayer game. So, and it's like, oh, no. We don't recognize this platform.

75
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,000
So you're cheating. That kind of stuff that totally puts people off. They don't want them

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to be here even though they totally are not. Talking about convenience, it's, well, it's

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,720
convenient for some people. The some, you know, I kind of count myself in the minority

78
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,840
because I can totally go behind the screen, do hours of stuff. But for what about others?

79
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,720
You know, what about the folks who just want to spend some time playing games on a weekend?

80
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,520
You know, someone who have a busy life. So you don't expect them to actually sit behind

81
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,400
their computer screens for like five hours configuring stuff, right? You want them to

82
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,600
actually be able to play games on the get go. It does not quite happen that way for the

83
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,360
most parts. Few games work as it is. Some of them require minimal configuration, like

84
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:01,240
some slides here, some slides there, maybe some versions of DXVK. But others, they don't

85
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,080
work at all. And, you know, you don't get to know that they don't work unless you spend

86
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,720
hours of it banging your head on the wall, trying to make them work. And then you realize

87
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:19,440
that they really don't. So the convenience, like, they follow through steps. But just

88
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,400
because the Linux distributions are so fragmented, we have a certain version of package manager

89
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,680
in a certain distribution. There's a certain way, certain root FS are installed, stuff

90
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,360
like that. So you can't quite expect a certain steps to actually work on one distributions

91
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,640
and to be replicated on something else. There would be certain steps that would be required

92
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,800
in between and it only comes with experience. But can we expect experience? Of course not.

93
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,960
So people have difficulties with doing that. And then people don't really want to spend

94
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,760
time. And it's all valid because guess what? People are there to play games, not to become

95
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:07,000
contributors in an open source software, right? Finally about performance, right? Say, one

96
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,600
of the things that happens with performance is the fact that there are games that run

97
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,600
comfortably, right? All fine, good frame rates, good graphics whatsoever. At the very same

98
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,120
time, if you use that same distribution, you thought, oh, this runs Final Fantasy. I might

99
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,280
as well run Warframe with that. Then it won't happen. It won't even load up, let alone have

100
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,920
good frame rates in that. So there is some Taylor fitting required, but that Taylor fitting

101
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,080
is, you know, works for one thing, but it does not work for something else. So you don't

102
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,360
have this one size fits all kind of a solution for gaming, which is sad. But then again,

103
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,440
it is what it is right now. And well, there are some publishers who do not even support

104
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,040
these environments. They're like, nope, not this, not that, nothing at all. We won't let

105
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:06,240
Linux users play our games because that's not how we do things. And look, people are

106
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,680
able to get frame rates. I was able to get a lot of frame rates, good performance, but

107
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,360
there have been times when it has been all inconsistent since the such thing has happened

108
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,120
with my friends as well using a variety of Linux distributions. So it's definitely not

109
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,440
just for all Linux, but my friends who actually use Pop OS just because it allows for having

110
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,440
NVIDIA drivers installed from a get go. So you don't really have to pop open a terminal

111
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,080
and do some crazy voodoo according to my non-technical friends to be able to install drivers.

112
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,280
It just works from the get go. But guess what? Even they have some inconsistent performances.

113
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,480
And then there are ports that are for Linux, but just because they are not a lot of takers

114
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,640
here again, telemetry, just because people don't get to know that there are actually

115
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,120
people playing their games trying to work hard to actually make them compatible, people

116
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:09,480
pull them out even if there was a version at some point in time. Right, so if all I

117
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:18,040
have are complaints, is it all bad? Is it something that does not run at all? What is it like?

118
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,960
You know, it's quite the opposite. It's not bad. The community has been doing a great

119
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:31,960
job. If I were to look back 10 years ago, people had to use wine as it is. And it's

120
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,880
a tool that gets things done, but then again, if you want things to be done, things need

121
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,920
to be abstracted for you to be able to understand it. And if someone of a web developer is made

122
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,400
to understand the things that go behind the scene, oh my God, then it's totally not worth

123
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,160
of doing. So there are tools like Lutris, play on Linux that abstract the stuff that

124
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:59,680
wine do. So it's a lot better right now than it has ever been before. But then again, there

125
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,840
are things that we can totally do to make things a lot more better than they are right

126
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,840
now. So there's a silver lining. It's a small market share. People can be unsatisfied with

127
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:19,880
big config files and stuff like that. But here are six ways that I think it's all subjective.

128
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,040
There can be other things that people can think as well that I can add in my list and

129
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,840
make it 60 probably. But one of the things that people need to understand is if it were

130
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:36,280
really a technical challenge, right? So we have a lot of people working hard to make

131
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:43,440
these things work. Drivers, no matter how hard it can be for the proprietary drivers,

132
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,760
the proprietary blocks, the kernel modules to be loaded up, people are working hard.

133
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,920
But people are not understanding how exactly is it affecting or influencing the gamers,

134
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,720
the folks who actually use GNU Linux distributions to be able to play these games. So there should

135
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,840
be some way of open metrics, you know, some kind of telemetry that is not shady. It does

136
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,600
not look through your context and understand, oh, this person needs to have this at a certain

137
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,000
point in time. Not that kind of metrics, but rather what exactly is the tool, what exactly

138
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,880
are the workflows that are used in order to make these video games work. So these reliable

139
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,240
metrics should be implemented for the developers to understand that, yeah, their works are

140
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,360
indeed worth it. And for the publishers, because, oh, boy, they think that the market

141
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,000
share is small. So in order for the rise in market share, which has been, for the most

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,720
parts, the ones that we get to see from Steam, we should have more than that. So I don't know

143
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,600
if there are metrics in looters, bottles, or emulators. And I guess there is not, apart

144
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,960
from the ones that they themselves collect, because guess what? They really want to see

145
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,200
if their stuff works or not, and how exactly can they improve their own software. But does

146
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:09,000
it add up to the entire GNU Linux gaming metrics and make people understand that, yeah, folks

147
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,880
using looters, folks using bottles, folks using Steam Deck, folks using Android, they all

148
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,600
combine together as being a market share for this entire gaming. I don't think so at this

149
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,800
point in time, but this is something that we should definitely consider.

150
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,000
The next thing, of course, is to account for feedback and promote participation. So I have

151
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,840
seen in the course of the last many years that if you make people feel like they are

152
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,800
being heard, no matter what kind of project it is, if it's just creating some websites

153
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,440
or deploying things on the infrastructure, or be it about gaming. If people are heard,

154
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,560
if the features that they suggest, if the bugs that they tell is, you know, is bothering

155
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,160
them are implemented, chances are that they will tell their friends that this is something,

156
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,200
this is some kind of tool that they make use of and they should make use of as well. And

157
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,480
I like to think that reporting for bugs is also a very valuable contribution. So, you

158
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,640
know, being empathetic to the users, understanding, you know, by putting themselves on their

159
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:19,440
shoes, what kind of issues that they end up facing. And finally, understanding the tools

160
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,920
that people make use of. If there are a lot of dials, if there are a lot of drop-downs,

161
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,360
if there are a lot of things that people have to do before they are able to run their games,

162
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,640
it's probably not the most convenient way of doing so. So you can't quite expect a

163
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,800
person coming back home after a long day to be able to tweak those stuffs and make them

164
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:45,000
work. So the usability of them, how do we make it more convenient, should be something

165
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,440
that we should look into in these distributions, you know, kind of streamline the entire workflow

166
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,480
in order to make sure that people know where exactly they need to go to, to get a certain

167
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,640
function, to get a certain settings applied. And that's more about the convenience of,

168
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,240
you know, so that people can focus solely on the video games and not around the operating

169
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,600
system that's built for the sake of running games. Because trust me, if you have a PC,

170
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,640
operating video games are the one thing out of a thousand things that you will do. So

171
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,960
it just makes it a lot more easier to focus on what they want. For convenience, we totally

172
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:30,800
should be able to abstract complex things when we need to. So customization is fine.

173
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,120
It's one of the reasons why we are fragmented and I'm kind of thankful for it, so that I

174
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,240
have a choice that I can customize a distribution of my own kind to be able to make something,

175
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,840
to serve a certain purpose. But for the folks who don't need, it's going to be overwhelming.

176
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,640
They're going to be really scared of all those options put out there in front of them and

177
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,560
they'll be like, oh my God, no, definitely not. And they'll run back to the thing that

178
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:04,400
they were playing games on. So it's definitely not something that we would want to do. Being

179
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,800
able to provide a balance between the two of them and, you know, organically finding,

180
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,880
oh, fine, this person is scrolling down the menu. So probably it's looking for something

181
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,200
that's a lot more extensive than what we have provided for. Some kind of organic way to

182
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,560
find it and to be able to demonstrate how they can do it is a way that would strike

183
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,200
a good balance between the complicated looking stuff and the people who really want to get

184
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:40,440
their job done as quick as possible. Finally, for distributions that actually prioritize

185
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:48,240
these tools, these workflows, these applications, these should be available, like, natively

186
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,200
in their own repositories or there should be a way to be able to install them and not,

187
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,840
like, build from source or, like, dot-slashing them out of the blue because who runs shell

188
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,120
script files anyway, right? You should definitely read them. Drivers, codecs, kernel modules

189
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,080
and things like that, if you don't have a way to update them natively, trust me, it's

190
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,800
really a bad choice to be able to using that distributions. Say, people are here to play

191
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,680
games not to build software from source. Say, definitely we should consider having all of

192
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:28,160
these things packaged natively. And finally, to build standard workflows to be able to

193
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,600
test and quantify that, yeah, what is good performance, what is bad? Now, me, I can be

194
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:41,240
really biased towards good performance even if I see 60 frames per second on a 165-hertz

195
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,320
screen. I can tell that is good, but for someone else, it's like, oh, no, it's just like one

196
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,400
third of that frame rate. How do you call it a good performance? In that very case,

197
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,640
we need to understand and tell that, yeah, this is the criteria that was used to tell

198
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,160
that, yeah, this video game actually runs and this video game does not and could use

199
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,520
some more work before it's able to be, well, executing the way it should be. And when we

200
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,640
have all of these things in place, probably the publishers of AAA titles, popular ones

201
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,040
like that will be able to understand that, yeah, there is some kind of standards used

202
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,920
in this fragmented world of distributions to be able to understand that, yeah, if we follow

203
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:31,640
these rules to be able to create our games, it will have a compatibility with at least

204
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,160
85 percent, 75 percent, I'm saying this on the top of my head, but at least majority

205
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,880
of distributions will not have a problem and you won't be actually told to use a certain

206
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,160
distribution just because, well, your friend uses it.

207
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:55,520
So let's have a case study of Fedora Workstation in the end. So we have had distributions based

208
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,840
on the top of Fedora Linux distribution, Nobara Workstation, they have added meaningful

209
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,000
additions on the top, so to be able to make sure that people who really are willing to

210
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,080
focus on video gaming, they don't have to install much stuff on the top of it. And you

211
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,720
know, it's heavily popular with the folks who develop bottles and looters because they

212
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,360
get the latest and greatest stuff in the official repository, so they don't really have to go

213
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,800
out of their way to do so. And then the required tooling to be able to run these games, drivers,

214
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,040
and the ability to install them from RPM Fusion just in case their proprietary in nature is

215
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,520
totally possible. And the fact that the GNOME desktop, well, what can I say, it's just one

216
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:47,160
of the great ones. I'm a bit biased. Say, you know, it totally keeps the workflows aligned

217
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,840
and well, unintuitive. And finally, talking about the consistent performance, well, let's

218
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,480
just say that the configurations should be done in a modular manner so as to make sure

219
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,160
that if I do certain thing, I can copy that stuff and give it to my friend. Here's, you

220
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,960
know, you don't have to spend many hours like I did, paste that stuff and this should

221
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,800
be running. Or something a bit more polished than that, but basically, no more repeating

222
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,640
of efforts. And, you know, customizable enough to be actually minimize the footprint of the

223
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,840
operating system, the distribution itself, to be able to dedicate more of that performance

224
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:29,600
over to the actual video games. And that's pretty much about it. I'm totally open to

225
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,400
your questions.

226
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:49,280
Thank you for your talk. I got the impression that you're pushing for telemetry to be used

227
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,360
more. Would that be right?

228
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,480
Well, let's just say I'm pushing for an open telemetry. So you get to see what kind of information

229
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:03,240
is being shared with the folks and what folks are you sharing that with. So you don't think

230
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,360
that, oh, it's the shady number of information and with the shady number of folks that it

231
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,080
is shared with, right? So telemetry is important. There are software that have telemetry like

232
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,960
pre-built and they have it natively done, but then again, it's just a limited set of telemetry

233
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,560
people. Once we unify this and have a place where we can say that, yeah, it's coming from

234
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,080
them, so there's something that we can improve upon in the distributions level so that we

235
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,240
can understand that, yeah, a certain application or an emulator is acting up and there's something

236
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:58,520
that we can act on. Any more questions?

237
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:17,720
Hey, thank you very much. I think on the telemetry side, there is a fundamental metric that the

238
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,720
developers look at which is sales. So I think the main thing is like there is a sort of

239
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,560
1-2% audience on Linux that will buy games. I think that's pretty clear. I think there

240
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,480
are other advantages for developers having Linux users in early. We tend to report bugs

241
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,520
and if we do that in a helpful and non-annoying way, then we can be an asset particularly

242
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,520
to the trend of people doing early access releases and wanting engaged users. So I think

243
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:49,000
that's the thing that you can think about supporting early access games, supporting

244
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,760
stuff on edge I think is helpful. The other side is like if you just want to play games,

245
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,720
by far the easiest thing to do is ignore your distribution, install Steam, Proton handles

246
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,520
the config wrapping around wine really conveniently and the best game of the last five years was

247
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,400
released natively on Linux anyway, so play Slay the Spire. Thank you.

248
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,600
Thank you so much. One of the things that you mentioned that probably we could have

249
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,080
some kind of telemetry done in a central basis and the fact that early access can be something

250
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,160
that we can provide to people using Linux. It's one of the things that we can totally

251
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,160
use to actually increase our market share and make people feel like it's worth it if

252
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,640
you give it a try and people might end up actually buying it. When it comes to Proton,

253
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,960
I mean, jeez, they have done a marvelous job by abstracting what's not important or what's

254
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,960
totally really, really scary. Might scare people away out of the room, leave their Steam

255
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,280
decks that they have purchased with their hard earned money and to be able to play games

256
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:53,680
while they're on the go. So it's some kind of abstraction that keeps things convenient

257
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,360
that we are all looking for and there should be a balance so people should go and be like,

258
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,760
jeez, it's so abstracted that I can't do anything anymore, right? So that should definitely

259
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,600
not happen. All right, folks, I'm going to give way to the next talk. Please find me

260
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:19,280
over here if you have more questions. Thank you so much again.
